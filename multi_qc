##This is a script to make a multiple Fastqc!

##First move all fq.gz file to a folder/or a workplace
mv */*.fq.gz ./(or the path you want)

##If the file type is not fq.gz ,you should try to convert them to fq.gz
##Then you can run fastqc 
##I put the results to a folder called result

for fastq_file in ./*.fq.gz
do
    fastqc $fastq_file
       mv ./*fastqc.html ./*fastqc.zip ./result/
done
echo "Ok!"

##But fatqc do not stat the Q30 and Q20 ,so I run fqcheck to get the feature of the data

for fastq_file in ./*/*.fq.gz
do
    /ifs1/Software/bin/fqcheck  -r $fastq_file -c ./fqcheck/${fastq_file}.fqcheck
done
echo "Ok!"


##At last, I extract the index of the data 

for fastq_file in ./*.fq.gz.fqcheck
do
    echo $fastq_file
    cat $fastq_file | awk 'END {print}'
done
echo "Ok!"
